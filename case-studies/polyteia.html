                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>
                    Polyteia began as a data service providing German municipalities with a comprehensive data analysis
                    solution. By aggregating, transforming, and analyzing data from various sources — such as Excel
                    files, administrative software, and databases — the company delivered insights through a
                    user-friendly dashboard, empowering municipalities to make data-driven decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This case study highlights key moments in the journey of evolving Polyteia’s flagship product from a
                    read-only dashboard into a fully integrated, browser-based BI platform. I played a leading role in
                    the research and design efforts, while also contributing to the overall product strategy and
                    management.

                <h2>Discovery & research</h2>
                <p>
                    Our decision to develop a Business Intelligence (BI) tool was driven by valuable feedback from
                    internal analysts, customer success teams, sales representatives, and our clients. From the outset, it was evident that our data platform needed to encompass the entire data
                    workflow—covering everything from data ingestion, transformation, and pipeline orchestration to
                    analysis and report creation—within a single platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To gain a deep understanding of the processes, technologies, and tools involved, I began by
                    interviewing data engineers and analysts. These interviews provided valuable insights into the
                    existing workflows and the challenges they faced, such as using multiple tools for different tasks.
                    I learned about the specific technologies we employed and the intricacies of the tasks that needed
                    to be streamlined.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to these interviews, I conducted extensive desk research to familiarize myself with the
                    fundamentals of data engineering. I also took the initiative to learn essential tools like SQL and
                    dbt, which allowed me to better grasp the technical aspects of the workflows I was aiming to
                    optimize.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the insights gathered from the interviews, I created and tested user flows to ensure that our
                    proposed solution met the needs of our users. To further refine the platform’s structure, I
                    conducted card sorting and tree testing workshops through Optimal Workshop.

                <h2>Design, prototype, test</h2>
                <p>
                    We embraced a collaborative approach throughout the design process. I conducted co-design sessions,
                    bringing together diverse perspectives from data engineers, analysts, and other stakeholders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before moving to high-fidelity prototypes in Figma, we spent significant time sketching and creating
                    paper prototypes. This hands-on approach allowed us to quickly iterate on ideas, identify potential
                    issues, and gather feedback early in the process. By exploring different design solutions on paper
                    first, we were able to focus on the core functionality and user experience without getting bogged
                    down in the finer details too soon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once we felt confident in the direction we were heading, we transitioned to Figma for creating
                    high-fidelity prototypes. This shift allowed us to bring our designs to life, incorporating the
                    feedback and insights gathered from our earlier sketches and co-design sessions.

                <p>
                    Especially when working on complex applications for expert users, I believe that a designer’s role
                    is not always to be in the driver’s seat. Technical users possess deep knowledge of processes and
                    tools, and more experienced individuals often have insights into the history behind these
                    systems—how they have evolved, why changes were made, and whether those changes were improvements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This knowledge is invaluable, and I believe the designer’s role is to harness and amplify it,
                    enabling these insights to shape the design. While the designer may still own the process, leading
                    it is not always necessary; instead, facilitating and highlighting the expertise of others can often
                    lead to a more effective and user-centered outcome.

                <h2>UX highlights</h2>
                <p>
                    My UX approach for the data platform was guided by a few core principles that ensured I created an
                    intuitive, accessible, and effective platform for all users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong> Making Complex Things Simple: </strong> One of our main goals was to simplify the
                    complexity inherent in data workflows. We focused on streamlining the user experience, distilling
                    complicated processes into straightforward, manageable tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong> Don’t Reinvent the Wheel: </strong> We recognized the value in leveraging existing
                    solutions and familiar tools. Rather than creating new, unfamiliar interfaces, we drew from
                    established patterns which our users already knew and trusted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong> Prioritise Accessibility: </strong> Accessibility was a top priority throughout the design
                    process. I ensured that the tool was usable by a diverse range of users, regardless of their
                    technical expertise or physical abilities. This included considering color contrast, keyboard
                    navigation, and screen reader compatibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong> Scale the Experience According to User Literacy: </strong> Understanding that our users had
                    varying levels of data literacy, I designed the platform to scale according to their needs. For
                    municipal officers with less technical experience, we offered a simple, no-code interface that
                    allowed them to perform tasks without diving into the complexities of data manipulation. At the same
                    time, we provided advanced features, like the ability to write SQL and JSON, for expert users who
                    required more control and flexibility in their work.
                </p>

                <h2>UI highlights</h2>
                <p>
                    To facilitate ease of use, I incorporated well-known dashboard patterns throughout the interface.
                    These familiar layouts and components helped users quickly understand and navigate the tool,
                    minimizing the learning curve and allowing them to focus on their tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides, I intentionally reused patterns across different sections of the platform, ensuring that
                    users would encounter familiar layouts and interactions regardless of the task they were performing.
                    For example, our multi-panel layout was designed to be versatile, serving as the foundation for
                    various tools within the platform, including the data explorer, report editor, form editor, and
                    widget editor. This consistency not only created a unified visual experience but also helped users
                    seamlessly transition between different tasks without needing to relearn the interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, to align the UI with our rebranded style guide, I updated our existing design system,
                    refreshing components and visual elements to reflect the new brand identity. In addition, I
                    incorporated components from the Flowbite library, enhancing our design system while cutting down on
                    design and development time. This allowed us to deliver a polished, cohesive interface more
                    efficiently, while also improving the overall quality and functionality of the UI.
