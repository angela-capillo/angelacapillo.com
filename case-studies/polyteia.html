                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>
                    Polyteia began as a service providing German municipalities with a comprehensive data analysis
                    solution. By aggregating, transforming, and analyzing data from various sources—such as Excel files,
                    administrative software, and databases—the company delivered insights through a user-friendly
                    dashboard called Polyteia Leto, empowering municipalities to make data-driven decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since its launch in 2018, Polyteia has secured significant funding from investors like Finparx, Bool
                    Capital, DvH Ventures, and DV Capital, all aimed at taking its product to the next level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This case study highlights key moments in the journey of evolving Polyteia’s flagship product from a
                    read-only dashboard into a fully integrated, browser-based BI platform. I played a leading role in
                    the research and design efforts, while also contributing to the overall product strategy and
                    management.

                <h2>The use case</h2>
                <p>
                    Our decision to develop a Business Intelligence (BI) tool was driven by valuable feedback from
                    internal analysts, customer success teams, sales representatives, and our clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <bold>Internal Analysts:</bold> They highlighted a pressing need for a unified workflow. The current
                    setup involved juggling multiple tools, which made tasks like code review and debugging increasingly
                    complex. As more dashboards were created, their workflow became sluggish and less efficient,
                    resulting in frustration and a need for a more streamlined solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <bold>Municipality Officers:</bold> These users expressed a desire for greater autonomy in managing
                    their data. Specifically, they wanted to streamline data collection and have the ability to create,
                    manage, and distribute their own surveys within their municipal networks. Previously, this process
                    was managed entirely by our analysts, leading to delays and inefficiencies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <bold>Expert Users in Municipalities:</bold> These users sought the freedom to generate their own
                    reports without relying on us for every step of the process, from data collection to transformation
                    and analysis. They wanted more control over their data, enabling them to make faster, data-driven
                    decisions independently.

                <h2>Discovery & research</h2>
                <p>
                    From the outset, it was evident that our data platform needed to encompass the entire data workflow
                    — covering everything from data ingestion, transformation, and pipeline orchestration to analysis
                    and report creation—within a single platform. This comprehensive approach was crucial to address the
                    pain points and inefficiencies experienced by our users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To gain a deep understanding of the processes, technologies, and tools involved, I began by
                    interviewing data engineers and analysts. These interviews provided valuable insights into the
                    existing workflows and the challenges they faced, such as using multiple tools for different tasks.
                    I learned about the specific technologies we employed and the intricacies of the tasks that needed
                    to be streamlined.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to these interviews, I conducted extensive desk research to familiarize myself with the
                    fundamentals of data engineering. I also took the initiative to learn essential tools like SQL and
                    dbt, which allowed me to better grasp the technical aspects of the workflows I was aiming to
                    optimize.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the insights gathered from the interviews, I created and tested user flows to ensure that our
                    proposed solution met the needs of our users. To further refine the platform’s structure, I
                    conducted card sorting and tree testing workshops through Optimal Workshop. These exercises were
                    instrumental in developing a new information architecture that would make the data platform
                    intuitive and user-friendly.
