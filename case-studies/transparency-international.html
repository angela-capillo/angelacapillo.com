                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>
                    Transparency International (TI) is a globally renowned organization dedicated to combating
                    corruption and promoting transparency, accountability, and integrity at all levels of government,
                    business, and civil society. Founded in 1993, the organization has built a strong reputation through
                    its efforts to expose corruption and advocate for systemic reforms, earning widespread recognition
                    for its impactful initiatives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This case study highlights key moments of the redesign of TI’s website, for which I led the
                    end-to-end design process, encompassing art direction, illustration, and interface design. The focus
                    was on creating a visually compelling, usable and inclusive platform for a diverse, global audience.

                <h2>The use case</h2>
                <p>
                    The redesign of Transparency International’s website addressed several critical challenges with its
                    outdated predecessor. Originally launched over 15 years ago and partially updated in 2012, the old
                    website was responsive for only 10% of its page content. This limitation made navigating the site on
                    mobile devices frustrating and inefficient, providing a subpar user experience for an increasingly
                    mobile-first audience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, the website failed to comply with any accessibility guidelines, excluding users with
                    disabilities and undermining the organization’s commitment to inclusivity. The need for an overhaul
                    was evident, not just to modernize functionality but also to ensure that the site adhered to WCAG
                    2.1 Level AA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The redesign also presented an opportunity to refresh the website’s look and feel, aligning it with
                    new visual guidelines that I created to reflect TI’s mission and values.
                </p>

                <h2>Discovery & research</h2>
                <p>
                    We began with a comprehensive discovery and research phase, combining quantitative and qualitative
                    methods. We distributed a survey via Microsoft Forms to our mailing list, gathering insights into
                    audience demographics, interests, and professions. The survey also explored what users liked and
                    disliked about the old website, the content they found most engaging, and their expectations for the
                    new design. This data provided a foundational understanding of our diverse user base and their
                    needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working collaboratively with the project manager and the development agency, we used Airtable to
                    organize and analyze the findings. This process led to the creation of detailed personas, each
                    assigned a priority level to reflect their importance in the redesign process. User journeys were
                    developed to highlight pain points and identify key features needed to enhance navigation and
                    improve the overall user experience. These insights shaped the requirements for a more intuitive and
                    accessible platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To refine the content hierarchy and improve information architecture, I facilitated focus groups and
                    design workshops. Together, we redefined the sitemap and organized content into clearer segments.

                <h2>Design, prototype, test</h2>
                <p>
                    Building on this foundation, I created sketches and low-fidelity wireframes in Figma, which were
                    reviewed and validated in stakeholder feedback sessions. To ensure usability, a functional prototype
                    was developed in Axure RP and tested with several users, providing valuable input for the next
                    phases of the redesign.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the prototype and test phase, I assessed all the patterns and components of approved
                    wireframes to create a big-picture design system for the new website. My blueprint established a
                    fresh UI palette that integrated the primary and secondary palettes from the original visual
                    guidelines and new icons and collateral illustrations, which followed TI’s original style.

                <h2>Measuring success</h2>
                <p>
                    The website redesign delivered significant improvements in user engagement, as reflected in the data collected through Plausible Analytics during the first six months post-launch. While we did not fully meet the ambitious goals we set, the results were strong enough to satisfy stakeholders and validate the redesign efforts. Comparing data from June to November 2020 to the same period in 2021, total page views increased by an impressive 183%, with mobile traffic up by 21% and desktop traffic showing substantial gains as well. The bounce rate saw a dramatic drop of 65%, indicating improved content relevance and usability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another key finding was the desire for a centralized, “one-stop-shop” solution that could integrate
                    data from various sources, automate repetitive tasks, and provide actionable insights. Participants
                    frequently highlighted the need for better visualization tools and dynamic data exploration features
                    to help them make quicker, more informed decisions. These enhancements were viewed as essential for
                    improving both individual productivity and team efficiency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Time spent on page also surged by 210%, with mobile and desktop sessions increasing by 17% and 8%, respectively. Call-to-action (CTA) conversions saw a significant boost as well, rising by 51% overall—17% from mobile devices and 8% from desktop users. These metrics highlight the success of the redesign in making the website more engaging, accessible, and effective for users across platforms, even as we continue to refine and optimize the experience further.
