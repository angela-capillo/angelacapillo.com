                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>
                    Elucidate is a leader in financial crime risk management, enabling financial institutions to
                    benchmark and price financial crime risk through its innovative platform, the Elucidate FinCrime
                    Index (EFI). Developed in collaboration with leading global correspondent banks, the EFI stands as
                    the market’s first regulated financial crime risk benchmark, authorized by the Federal Financial
                    Supervisory Authority (BaFin) and registered with the European Security and Markets Authority
                    (ESMA).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This case study showcases key moments in a user research initiative aimed at uncovering a "killer
                    feature" while gathering valuable feedback from our customers. The goal was to identify
                    opportunities to enhance the product and better align it with user needs. I led the research
                    efforts, conducting interviews and synthesizing insights, which informed both product improvements
                    and strategic decisions for future development.

                <h2>Context & planning</h2>
                <p>
                    I collaborated closely with the product team and key stakeholders to define clear objectives and a
                    structured research plan. These objectives included gaining a deeper understanding of user
                    workflows, identifying challenges in their processes, and exploring how the platform could better
                    meet their needs. The research plan also aimed to gather actionable insights to inform future
                    product development and prioritize features for the roadmap.

                <h2>Methodology</h2>
                <p>
                    To gather meaningful insights, we adopted a hybrid approach that combined quantitative and
                    qualitative methods. We began with a survey to collect broad, preliminary data on user needs and
                    experiences, followed by in-depth, semi-structured interviews to explore these insights further.
                    Using tools like SurveyMonkey for surveys and Miro and Zoom for interviews, we ensured the process
                    was efficient and collaborative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The participant pool was chosen to represent a mix of long-term and recently onboarded users. Roles
                    varied across compliance, risk management, and due diligence, allowing us to capture diverse
                    perspectives and experiences. This diversity helped paint a comprehensive picture of user workflows
                    and challenges while revealing commonalities across different roles and institutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout the process, the interviews were designed to be interactive and flexible. Questions
                    focused on understanding participants' daily tasks, the tools they used, and the specific pain
                    points they encountered. This approach fostered open dialogue, enabling us to dig deeper into users'
                    frustrations and desires while building rapport with participants. The combination of structured and
                    exploratory methods ensured rich, actionable data for the next phase.

                <h2>Analysis</h2>
                <p>
                    We began by clustering feedback from interviews and surveys into themes, identifying trends and
                    patterns that spanned different roles and institutions. Tasks were categorized based on frequency,
                    difficulty, and user sentiment, providing a nuanced view of how users navigated their day-to-day
                    workflows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The process involved creating detailed transcripts of the interviews and extracting meaningful
                    insights. These insights were coded — summarized into concise phrases — and organized into topics of
                    interest. Codes were then iteratively clustered into broader themes by identifying similarities and
                    patterns. Adjustments were made throughout the process, splitting or regrouping themes as needed to
                    ensure clarity and alignment with the research questions.
                </p>

            <section class="text-wrapper">
                <p>
                    Finally, each theme was defined and documented to capture its essence and its relevance to the
                    study’s goals. This structured approach not only provided clarity but also ensured that the themes
                    effectively answered the core research questions, laying a strong foundation for subsequent
                    reporting and ideation phases.

                <h2>Findings</h2>
                <p>
                    The research uncovered several critical insights about how users interacted with the compliance
                    platform and their broader workflows. While most participants expressed satisfaction with the
                    platform’s existing features, many pointed to inefficiencies caused by manual processes and the need
                    to juggle multiple tools. Users emphasized the importance of streamlining workflows to save time and
                    reduce the burden of compliance tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another key finding was the desire for a centralized, “one-stop-shop” solution that could integrate
                    data from various sources, automate repetitive tasks, and provide actionable insights. Participants
                    frequently highlighted the need for better visualization tools and dynamic data exploration features
                    to help them make quicker, more informed decisions. These enhancements were viewed as essential for
                    improving both individual productivity and team efficiency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite challenges, users expressed a strong sense of expertise and passion for their work. They
                    valued tools that complemented their skills and allowed them to focus on high-impact tasks. This
                    feedback reinforced the need for a platform that not only simplifies workflows but also empowers
                    users by providing advanced capabilities for those with higher technical proficiency.

                <h2>Outcomes</h2>
                <p>
                    The research findings were instrumental in shaping the product roadmap, leading to tangible outcomes
                    that addressed user needs. Key recommendations included integrating automation to reduce manual
                    effort, enhancing data visualization tools for better insights, including new tools to help users in
                    their decision-making process, and consolidating features into a unified interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These insights led to Elucidate's Risk Module Builder, a "build-your-own" risk analysis system where
                    users can pick and combine modules like data validation, compliance monitoring, and transaction
                    pattern analysis. Each module works on its own, but also work together to create a complete risk
                    assessment system that integrates with users’ existing tools.
